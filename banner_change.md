For changing the banner first go to the script in **[Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/)**.

Then get the link of the image you want to use and replace the one in the code. It has to be the link to the image directly so it has a .gif or .png or .jpg on the end, otherwise it wont work.

Then your image will be there:

But the image is displayed from the top down so only the top part of it is displayed. To fix this you need to save the image, crop off the top of it in something like paint or  photoshop and then upload it to a site like **[Imgur](https://imgur.com/)** or **[Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/)**. Then repeat the above steps to add the image to the banner.
