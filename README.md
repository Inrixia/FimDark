This is just a dark theme for Fim and a Banner that lets people set their own images.

The Banner is based off FimFictionAdvanced by Sollace. Totally go check that out here: https://sta.sh/01pfv954kl8r

For changing the image on the banner there is a link contained inside the code. Its clearly labled, just copy a link from any site or upload your own image to a site like imgur and put the url where the default one is. Make sure to press Ctrl-S to save it before going out.
